I'm a London-based CTO with a strong background in Ruby on Rails and a product-first mindset. I enjoy building products that people genuinely want to use and leading teams that ship great solutions.

My approach is hands-on, concentrating on improving development processes, overcoming technical challenges, and ensuring teams remain efficient. I have experience across multiple startups, where Iâ€™ve been responsible for transforming concepts into practical, scalable products.

Outside of work, I keep up to date with new technology and invest in companies I believe in.
