# Hello :wave:

I'm a software engineer based in London.
I identify solutions to business problems through interactive design and development. I build scalable, tested products from start to finish, back to front: this is my passion.

I enjoy programming day to day in Ruby/Rails, Elixir/Phoenix, Javascript/Ember and Elm. I would love to spend some time dabbling with Swift, Go and Rust.

I've worked on problems ranging from scalable, non-blocking webscrapers to client-side analytics dashboards; Multi-platform, native MVPs to multi-region, multi-lingual training products.
