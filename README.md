I'm a London-based CTO specializing in Ruby on Rails with a product-first approach. I build products people want to use and lead teams that ship.

I split my time between hands-on development and team leadership. My focus is on improving how teams work and solving the technical challenges that matter. Across multiple startups, I've taken products from concept to scale.

Outside of work, I keep up to date with new technology and invest in companies I believe in.
